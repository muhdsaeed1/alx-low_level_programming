This is a tutorial and exercise on nested loops ; loops are used in writing codes if there more than one arguements , decisions to be made in one program or algorithm .

Based on this the following exercises shows the best way to apply nested loops into a program .


Task 0: Writes a function that checks for uppercase characters.

Task 1: Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

Task2: Write a function that multiplies two integers.

Task 3: Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Task 4: Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Task 5: Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

Task 6: Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

Task 7: Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

Task 8: Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line

Task 9: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line..

Task 10: Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
